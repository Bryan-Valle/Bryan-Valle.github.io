			<p class="contenttitle">AIR JORDAN</p>
			<p class="content">Shoes were just shoes for the first 80-some-odd years of the 20th century. Then in the mid-1980s, Nike released a pair of basketball shoes featuring a certain ex-Tarheel. The Air Jordan was born, and the rest, as they say, is history.
			</p>
			<p class="content2">As legend has it, the iconic Air Jordan sneaker series almost never lifted off. Soon after Michael Jordan debuted the Air Jordan I, the NBA stepped in and banned the shoe because they featured "non-regulation" colors. Suffice it to say, Jordan didn't listen and thusly, the great basketball shoe boom began.

				<button type="button">One of the most revered silhouettes in the game, the Air Jordan 1 is iconic for a slew of reasons. Aside from being the first release in what became the most coveted series in sneaker history, its nostalgic Bulls-inspired colorway also caused a ton of commotion on and off court.</button>

			<p class="name">AIR JORDAN XI</p>
				<button type="button">Tinker Hatfield thought that Nike should pull out all the stops and make a shoe out of materials that had never been used in a basketball shoe. Not only was it the patent leather on the Air Jordan XI made them special, but the addition of a lightweight Phylon midsole with a full-length Air-Sole unit made it a revolutionary model back then.</button>

			<p class="name">AIR JORDAN III</p>
				<button type="button">The Air Jordan 3 is Michael Jordanâ€™s third signature basketball shoe and remains as one of the most sought after sneakers to-date. They were the first pair of Jordan sneakers that legendary designer Tinker Hatfield created, and they made their official debut in the year 1988.</p>
