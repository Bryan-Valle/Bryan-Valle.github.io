		<p class="title1">HIS AIRNESS</p>
			<p class="content1">Jordan brand is a household name and people of all ages and social status line up eagerly for the release of the latest Air Jordan model. Some of this success can be attributed to the fact that the shoes, from the Jordan III to the most recent model, have always been about Michael Jordan. The designers take his ideas, hobbies, and life into account and incorporate these feelings into the shoes. A number of Jordans have been designed after Jordanâ€™s cars and some of the more recent models. The Air Jordan line continues its tradition of quality, high-fashion basketball and athletic shoes that appeal to the masses.

			<p class="name" style="margin-bottom: 14px;">THE JUMPMAN LOGO</p>
				<button type="button">The image of Jordan that inspired the "Jumpman" logo was produced in a photoshoot for Life magazine. It was not long until Jordan himself knew that this pose would give rise to one of the most iconic logos ever used in a shoe.</button>

			<p class="name" style="margin-bottom: 9px;">THE DESIGNER</p>
				<button type="button">Tinker Hatfield is one of the best shoe designers during Jordan's time. Tinker was the first one to design a Jordan shoe which featured the very iconic Jumpman logo.</button>

			<p class="name">THE BRED COLORWAY</p>
				<button type="button">The "Bred" colorway first intended to be a homage to Jordan's basketball team at that time, the Chicago Bulls. But not long after the first bred colorway was produced, the NBA wished to ban them in games, which made it have a surprising and very unique history.</button>
